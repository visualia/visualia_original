# FAQ

**Why not package.json? Why not npm?**

Visualia embraces the future of Javascript modules and is very much inspired by projects such as [Deno](https://deno.land/std/manual.md), [Pika](https://www.pika.dev/) and [reg](https://github.com/mikeal/reg) for next-generation ESM-based Javascript package management.

**What about versioning the releases?**

During the initial development, the development happens in the latest `master` branch. In the future, a simple versioning system could be introduced.

**Why not Typescript?**

It is a viable option and could provide excellent developer experience for the framework consumers. Visualia still prioritizes minimal tooling and directly accessible source code over the Typescript benefits.

Note that this could be reconsidered in the future, giving Typescript-based Deno is part of the project toolchain already.
