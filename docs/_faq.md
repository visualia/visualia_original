# FAQ

**What about versioning the releases?**

During the initial development, the development happens in the latest `master` branch. In the future, a simple versioning system could be introduced.

**Why not Typescript?**

It is a viable option and could provide excellent developer experience for the framework consumers. Visualia still prioritizes minimal tooling and directly accessible source code over the Typescript benefits.
